Certainly. Here are the questions from the image in a copyable text format.

--BUSINESS INSIGHT QUERIES

-- Q1. Find the top 10 best-value products based on the discount percentage.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountpercent
FROM zepto 
ORDER BY discountpercent DESC
LIMIT 10;
----So, this is usefull for both customers looking for barganes and for businesses to know which products are being heavily promoted. 


-- Q2. What are the Products with High MRP but Out of Stock.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, category, outofstock
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 300 and outofstock = True
ORDER BY mrp DESC;
----So, these are products which company needs to restock, if customers buying them frequently.


-- Q3. Calculate Estimated Revenue for each category
SELECT category, sum(discountedsellingprice * quantity) AS estimated_revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY estimated_revenue DESC;
----So, company got the most of the revenue from 'Packaged Food' category.


-- Q4. Find all products where MRP is greater than â‚¹500 and discount is less than 10%.
SELECT DISTINCT name, category, mrp, discountpercent
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountpercent < 10
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountpercent DESC;
----So, these are already popular enough and selling well that's why discount on them is less.


-- Q5. Identify the top 5 categories offering the highest average discount percentage.
SELECT category, ROUND(avg(discountpercent),2) as avg_discountpercent
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_discountpercent DESC LIMIT 5;
----So, it will helpfull to check which categories cuts are high.


-- Q6. Find the price per gram for products above 100g and sort by best value.
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightingms, discountedsellingprice,
ROUND(discountedsellingprice/weightingms,2) AS price_per_gram
FROM zepto
where weightingms > 100
ORDER BY price_per_gram;

-- Q7. Group the products into categories like Low, Medium, Bulk.
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightingms,
CASE 
    WHEN weightingms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
	WHEN weightingms > 5000 THEN 'Medium'
	ELSE 'High'
END AS weight_category
FROM zepto;


-- Q8. What is the Total Inventory Weight Per Category
SELECT category, sum(weightingms * availablequantity) AS total_weight
FROM zepto 
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_weight;
----This is very gratefull in warehouse planning and identifying bulky product category.
