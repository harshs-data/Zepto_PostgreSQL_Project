--data analysis

-- Q1. Find the top 10 best-value products based on the discount percentage.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent
FROM zepto
ORDER BY discountPercent DESC
LIMIT 10;
----So, this is usefull for both customers looking for barganes and for businesses to know which products are being heavily promoted. 


--Q2.What are the Products with High MRP but Out of Stock

SELECT DISTINCT name,mrp
FROM zepto
WHERE outOfStock = TRUE and mrp > 300
ORDER BY mrp DESC;
----So, these are products which company needs to restock, if customers buying them frequently.


--Q3.Calculate Estimated Revenue for each category
SELECT category,
SUM(discountedSellingPrice * availableQuantity) AS total_revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue;
----So, company got the most of the revenue from 'Packaged Food' category.


-- Q4. Find all products where MRP is greater than â‚¹500 and discount is less than 10%.
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountPercent < 10
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountPercent DESC;
----So, these are already popular enough and selling well that's why discount on them is less.


-- Q5. Identify the top 5 categories offering the highest average discount percentage.
SELECT category,
ROUND(AVG(discountPercent),2) AS avg_discount
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_discount DESC
LIMIT 5;
----So, it will helpfull to check which categories cuts are high.


-- Q6. Find the price per gram for products above 100g and sort by best value.
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightInGms, discountedSellingPrice,
ROUND(discountedSellingPrice/weightInGms,2) AS price_per_gram
FROM zepto
WHERE weightInGms >= 100
ORDER BY price_per_gram;

--Q7.Group the products into categories like Low, Medium, Bulk.
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightInGms,
CASE WHEN weightInGms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
	WHEN weightInGms < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
	ELSE 'Bulk'
	END AS weight_category
FROM zepto;

--Q8.What is the Total Inventory Weight Per Category 
SELECT category,
SUM(weightInGms * availableQuantity) AS total_weight
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
----This is very gratefull in warehouse planning and identifying bulky product category.

ORDER BY total_weight;
